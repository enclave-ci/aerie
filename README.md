# Aerie

Aerie is a command-line tool designed to streamline the process of setting up a new server. It automates the creation of a new user, installation of essential software (including Docker and Docker Compose), and configuration of UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on a remote server.

## üì¶ Installation

To install Aerie, ensure you have Go 1.21.12 or later installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/enclave-ci/aerie.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd aerie
```

3. Build the project:

```
go build
```

## üöÄ Usage

To use Aerie, run the following command:

```
./aerie --host <server-ip> --user <new-username> [--ssh-key <path-to-ssh-key>] [--root-key <path-to-root-key>]
```

Required flags:
- `--host, -H`: The IP address of the target server
- `--user, -u`: The username for the new user to be created

Optional flags:
- `--ssh-key, -k`: Path to the SSH public key file for the new user
- `--root-key, -r`: Path to the root SSH private key file

Example:
```
./aerie --host 192.168.1.100 --user newadmin --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub --root-key ~/.ssh/root_id_rsa
```

## üîë SSH Key Handling

Aerie provides flexible options for SSH key management:

### Root SSH Key
- If `--root-key` is provided, Aerie will use this key to connect to the server as root.
- If not provided, Aerie will search for a suitable SSH key in the following order:
  1. `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
  2. `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`
  3. `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- If no suitable key is found, Aerie will return an error.

### New User SSH Key
- If `--ssh-key` is provided, Aerie will use this key for the new user.
- If not provided, Aerie will search for a suitable SSH key in the same order as the root key.
- If no suitable key is found for the new user, Aerie will use the root key for the new user.

This flexible approach allows Aerie to work with your existing SSH setup while providing options for custom key paths when needed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Aerie doesn't require any additional configuration files. All necessary parameters are passed as command-line arguments.
